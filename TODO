netlib.c:196 - set a timeout for waiting for the remote UDP start

NATHack

 - unify the config as one (local) setting, and use a connection
   cookie passed to coordinate which side goes passive.  The server
   wins in all ties.  auth.c:195

 - lose the global variable and move it into the vtun struct.  For
   now.  main.c:54, vtun.h:111

 - generally clean up the cfg_file.y and main.c stuff.  

2.6 compatibility

 - has to remain.

 - needs a cleanup too, so the redundant file isn't in there.
